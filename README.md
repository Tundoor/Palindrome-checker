# Palindrome Checker
### FreeCodeCamp Certification Project no.1

This is a palindrom checker. It checks whether a word can be written both forwards and backwards. The tech stacks used were HTML5, CSS, Javascript. 
This project helped stregthen my knowledge of array methods and string methods aswell. 

Challenges Faced:
Working with regex but ended up finding a solution and learning much more about how to use regex. 
I also faced the issue of whether my palindrome was strictly alphanumeric only or one that wasn't as strict. The one here on my github is a non strict alpha numeric checker rather than the strict one needed in the 
freeCodeCamp curiculum.
